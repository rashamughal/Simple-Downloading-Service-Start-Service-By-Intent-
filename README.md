This Android application demonstrates how to implement a background service that downloads a file from a URL using DownloadManager. The app features an 
EditText where users can input a URL and a button to start the service that handles the file download.

Features

Start a background service using an Intent.
Download a file from a given URL via Android's DownloadManager.
Notifications indicating download progress and completion.
Simple UI with an EditText to input the URL and a button to initiate the download.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
Android Studio (latest version recommended)
Android SDK version 21 or higher

Project Structure

MainActivity.java: Provides the UI for inputting a URL and starting the download service.

MyService1.java: A background service that handles the download of the file from the provided URL.

activity_main.xml: Layout file containing the EditText and button for user interaction.

How It Works

The user inputs a URL in the EditText.
When the "Start Service" button is pressed, the app starts a service (MyService1) using an Intent.
The URL is passed to the service through the Intent.
The service uses Android's DownloadManager to download the file and show notifications about the download status.
Code Walkthrough

Starting the Service
java
Copy code

Intent ServiceIntent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, MyService1.class);

String Url = editText.getText().toString();

ServiceIntent.putExtra("url", Url);

startService(ServiceIntent);

This code in MainActivity starts the service and passes the URL from the EditText as an extra.

Downloading the File

java
Copy code

DownloadManager downloadManager = (DownloadManager) getSystemService(DOWNLOAD_SERVICE);
Uri downloadUri = Uri.parse(URL);
DownloadManager.Request request = new DownloadManager.Request(downloadUri);
request.setAllowedNetworkTypes(DownloadManager.Request.NETWORK_WIFI | DownloadManager.Request.NETWORK_MOBILE);
request.setTitle("File Download");
request.setDescription("Downloading file from the provided URL");
request.setNotificationVisibility(DownloadManager.Request.VISIBILITY_VISIBLE_NOTIFY_COMPLETED);
request.setDestinationInExternalPublicDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS, "downloadedfile.zip");
downloadManager.enqueue(request);
The downloadFile method in MyService1 manages the download using the DownloadManager.
